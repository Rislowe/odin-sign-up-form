# odin-sign-up-form

## Introduction

The following project is a front-end sign up page that I created for the Odin Project. This is not a real page and was created and styled to look like an mock-up picture which I have provided in the **Example** folder. The picture displayed in the background on the left of the page has been taken from Marek Piwnicki on Unsplash.

## How to Use

This site is not wired up to anything and is also not finished yet. The most you can do at the moment is type random information in the inputs which should all work on a basic level at the moment.

## Next Steps

What should this project do?
- Mask inputs in the Passwords page
- Password inputs should turn red if the input is not the same in both
- Look prettier than it currently does now
  - I am still working on the styling to make the project mine
  - This includes possibly adding some new fonts, improving the layouts, and tweaking the colours a little bit
